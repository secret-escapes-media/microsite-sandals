    description: Music is impossible to ignore in Jamaica. It shakes dance halls when the sun goes down, it wakes you up from corner sound systems playing oldies, and it spills from the record shops still harbouring coveted island classics. From ska to rocksteady, rub a dub to dancehall, music is Jamaica’s lifeblood – get in the dance.
