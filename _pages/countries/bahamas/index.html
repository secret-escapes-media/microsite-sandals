      <p>This glamorous island is home to one of the Bahamasâ€™ most unique sites. The eastern coastline is blessed with pink beaches, a rare phenomenon that makes your beach day that little bit more special.

      <p>Exuma has become internationally renowned for this rather odd sight. It is here that wild pigs, quite naturally, enjoy a dip in the sea to cool off from the balmy heat. They, evidently, are very relaxed, meaning you too can swim alongside these irresistible chums.</p>
