  <p class="text--xl">A patchwork of colourful villages give way to sheltered coves lapped by turquoise waters at this unassuming Caribbean starlet. </p>
  <p class="text--xl">Antigua was historically the premier Caribbean destination, now lesser travelled and therefore a truly serene outpost in the balmy waters of this famous sea. It easily matches and often surpasses the beauty of the other islands, with bright, technicolour villages lining exotic bays and colonial harbours offering a refined glamour to savvy travellers.</p>

      <p>This crescent shaped bay is a true paradise on the eastern shores of Antigua. Completely underdeveloped, it offers a natural sanctuary for whiling away the day under the hot Caribbean sun. The waters are startlingly clear, the sands powder light, and the surroundings picture postcard perfect. It doesn’t get as irresistible as this.</p>

  - title: Frigate Bird Sanctuary

      <p>Head for Codrington Lagoon and take a boat through the protected estuary that it hosts. A licensed sea taxi is the only way to reach this remote National Park, home to one of the world’s largest colonies of frigatebirds. As you glide through, a chorus of chirps and squawks fills the air. These exotic, rather odd looking birds with their jet black feathers juxtaposed against their billowing, bright red necks, are spectacle not to be missed.</p>

  - title: English Harbour

      <p>Rich in Antigua’s colonial history, English Harbour is a collection of tropical bays and coves now frequented by yachts and holidaymakers. Old English forts like Fort Berkeley and Fort George line the coast, offering a rich history to discover. Fine dining is plentiful, and Sunday night parties at the Lookout on Shirley Heights are famous.</p>
