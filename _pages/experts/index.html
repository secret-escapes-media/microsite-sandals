      <h3 class="title title--dark title--micro title--bold title--extra-margin">What first brought you to the Caribbean?</h3>
      <p>Our first trip to the Caribbean was to Negril, Jamaica. We needed to escape the Wisconsin winter in March so headed down to the islands for our first taste of the Caribbean. </p>
      <h3 class="title title--dark title--micro title--bold title--extra-margin">Which, so far, has been you favourite island and why?</h3>
      <p>It's tough to choose just one island, but if we had to it would be Jamaica. This Caribbean gem was our first international trip together, so it will always be a special place to us. It's a place we instantly fell in love with. So much so, we later returned to get married on the beach! </p>
      <h3 class="title title--dark title--micro title--bold title--extra-margin">What special experiences would you recommend to people planning a Caribbean escape?</h3>
      <p>Plan at least a day or two off the resort exploring the island. If you are in the Bahamas you have to visit the nearby islands with the swimming pigs, and in Jamaica, head to Dunn's River Falls or the Pelican Bar – a bar literally floating in the middle of the ocean! In short, hire a driver for the day to get a taste of the life outside the resort.</p>
      <h3 class="title title--dark title--micro title--bold title--extra-margin">Of all the bountiful food on offer, what’s your favourite Caribbean dish?</h3>
      <p>When in the Caribbean we head straight for the seafood – Oistins fish market in Barbados is as fresh and tasty as the come. The tuna steaks are out of this world and you can't miss the grilled Caribbean lobsters! In Jamaica, you can find us at the jerk chicken shacks! </p>

    <div class="row__column">
      <h3 class="title title--dark title--micro title--bold title--extra-margin">What, in your opinion, is the best way to explore this enigmatic mix of islands?</h3>
      <p>We find the best way to explore the Caribbean is one island at a time. Each island has its own history, culture, and cuisine. Even though the islands may be close to each other, they are actually each very unique. Set your sights on an island and stay long enough to enjoy and understand the culture of the place.</p>
      <h3 class="title title--dark title--micro title--bold title--extra-margin">What is the best way to get to grips with the vibrant and colourful culture of the islands?</h3>
      <p>The best way to understand a culture is just to simply talk to people. In general, people that call the Caribbean home are warm and friendly and will gladly talk about their island. </p>
      <h3 class="title title--dark title--micro title--bold title--extra-margin">Any further advice for anyone planning a Caribbean break?</h3>
      <p>Find an island that fits your personal style to have the best experience in the Caribbean. Some islands like to party and some are more laid back. Larger islands tend to have a mix of both and are better suited to travelers who like a variety. You really can't go too wrong in the Caribbean, but a little planning helps you make the most of your holiday. </p>

          <p class="title title--bold title--micro title--spacing">Crane Beach</p>
          <p>This was our favorite beach! The Crane is located on the lower east coast of the island. The sand here has a pinkish hue to it from the seashells – a paradise for sure! </p>

          <p class="title title--bold title--micro title--spacing">Oistin’s Fish Market</p>
          <p>This is the place to be Friday nights for food and a party. Every night it’s a fresh seafood market with lots of stalls cooking up the day’s catch. Here I had some of the best seafood I have ever had!</p>

          <p class="title title--bold title--micro title--spacing">Mullins Bay</p>
          <p>Located on the west coast of the island on the northern end. This was another favorite beach of ours. Again much more secluded than the beaches on the southwestern tip of the island for perfect days of serene beach bliss!</p>

          <p class="title title--bold title--micro title--spacing">Diving</p>
          <p>Gearing up to dive into 80° water sounds a lot more enjoyable than gearing up to shovel the snow from your doorstep. We got a few tanks in on our most recent trip to Jamaica at Sandals Ochi, and the best part was the diving which was included with our stay in Ocho Rios. Diving in Jamaica is a must.</p>

          <p class="title title--bold title--micro title--spacing">The Pelican Bar</p>
          <p>What’s not to love about a bar constructed of sticks almost a Kilometer from the shore? This one of a kind bar serves beer, drinks and upon special request food from the shore. The only way to reach the pelican bar is by boat. If you take the trip out to the bar keep your eyes open for dolphins swimming as you sail out to the bar.</p>

          <p class="title title--bold title--micro title--spacing">The Falls</p>
          <p>Jamaica has a few famous waterfalls to check out while on the Island. Near Ocho Rios visit Dunn’s Falls.  On the west side of the island, YS falls is worth a visit.</p>

          <p>Pigs swimming in crystal clear turquoise water in the Bahamas – Sign me up! These furry little tropical pigs were pretty much the selling point of our recent trip to the Bahamas. As if we really needed to be sold on going to the Bahamas. Swimming with the pigs here we come!</p>
