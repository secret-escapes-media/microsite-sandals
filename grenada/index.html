introduction: >
  Home to both black sand and white sand beaches with water so blue and clear that coral formations can be spotted from the air, Grenada's volcanic origin has created a landscape of great beauty and variety, with rainforests, a 13-acre crater lake, cascading cliffs, and hot springs. Explore the natural splendour of the lush terrain and discover the history of the Island of Spice with visits to historic forts or the underwater sculpture park. The capital city St. George's epitomizes the spirit of this beautiful island, housing both colourful and unique structures and giving visitors a true sense of Grenada's historical past and extraordinarily beautiful present. Be sure to visit if you can tear yourself away from the beach.
