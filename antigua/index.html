introduction: >
  Antigua is historically one of the Caribbean's premier destinations. Today, Antigua remains a sailor's dream hosting one of the world's foremost regattas during the annual Sailing Week. It is also nirvana for sun worshipers, honeymooners, and anyone seeking powdery white-sand beaches caressed by clear aquamarine waters, balmy breezes, and coral reefs ideal for snorkelling and scuba diving.
