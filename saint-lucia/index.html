introduction: >
  Gaze at the world famous peaks of Gros Piton and Petit Piton. These majestic cones offer a glimpse into the volcanic origins of Saint Lucia, a tantalising taste of the dynamic forces that formed this beautiful island and that animate her still to this day. Saint Lucia is a true tropical rainforest - 19,000 acres filled with vivid flowering vines, luxuriant greenery, approximately 30 species of birds, and a whole menagerie of spectacular fauna. It’s also renowned as one of the top sites for whale watching in the entire world; a sight you’re unlikely to ever forget.
