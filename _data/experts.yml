    Hannah and Adam (@gettingstamped) embody the lifestyle we all dream of. Having been brave enough to up-sticks and discover the world, the intrepid couple have been travelling non-stop since 2013. We caught up with them for some top tips on exploring the Caribbean...

  questions:

    - question: What first brought you to the Caribbean?
      answer: Our first trip to the Caribbean was to Negril, Jamaica. We needed to escape the Wisconsin winter in March so headed down to the islands for our first taste of the Caribbean.

    - question: Which, so far, has been your favourite island and why?
      answer: It's tough to choose just one island, but if we had to it would be Jamaica. This Caribbean gem was our first international trip together, so it will always be a special place to us. It's a place we instantly fell in love with. So much so, we later returned to get married on the beach!

    - question: What special experiences would you recommend to people planning a Caribbean escape?
      answer: Plan at least a day or two off the resort exploring the island. If you are in the Bahamas you have to visit the nearby islands with the swimming pigs, and in Jamaica, head to Dunn's River Falls or the Pelican Bar – a bar literally floating in the middle of the ocean! In short, hire a driver for the day to get a taste of the life outside the resort.

    - question: Of all the bountiful food on offer, what’s your favourite Caribbean dish?
      answer: When in the Caribbean we head straight for the seafood – Oistins fish market in Barbados is as fresh and tasty as the come. The tuna steaks are out of this world and you can't miss the grilled Caribbean lobsters! In Jamaica, you can find us at the jerk chicken shacks!

    - question: What, in your opinion, is the best way to explore this enigmatic mix of islands?
      answer: We find the best way to explore the Caribbean is one island at a time. Each island has its own history, culture, and cuisine. Even though the islands may be close to each other, they are actually each very unique. Set your sights on an island and stay long enough to enjoy and understand the culture of the place.

    - question: What is the best way to get to grips with the vibrant and colourful culture of the islands?
      answer: The best way to understand a culture is just to simply talk to people. In general, people that call the Caribbean home are warm and friendly and will gladly talk about their island.

    - question: Any further advice for anyone planning a Caribbean break?
      answer: Find an island that fits your personal style to have the best experience in the Caribbean. Some islands like to party and some are more laid back. Larger islands tend to have a mix of both and are better suited to travelers who like a variety. You really can't go too wrong in the Caribbean, but a little planning helps you make the most of your holiday.

  intro: Yasmina Cherquaoui works tirelessly for Sandals to ensure customers only the finest opulent stays in the Caribbean. She knows a thing or two about these resorts, so we asked her a few questions to illuminate these island stays...

  questions:

    - question: Which is your favourite island?
      answer: A very difficult question! Nearly impossible to answer, but were you to twist my arm, I would have to say Jamaica. I love that the moment you get off the plane you know you are in Jamaica; you can feel the pulse of the island, the vibrancy of the people - the music, culture and food are the cherry on the cake.  Plus Jamaicans are some of the friendliest and funniest people you will meet. The island itself has everything I love, from the idyllic white sand beaches with turquoise waters to the perfect playground for adventure in the interior beset with waterfalls, rivers and mountains to explore.

    - question: Which is your favourite Sandals resort?
      answer: I think I am going to have to say Sandals Emerald Bay, yet I may be slightly biased as I lived in the Bahamas. I’m a beach bum and it has the most amazing mile long beach with sand as soft as icing sugar! The Exuma chain of islands are magical - if you like water, it is heaven. The sea is so clear and blue; you have to remove your sunglasses to check it’s not a filter! It is also home to the swimming pigs. There is nothing more memorable than a day on a boat followed by a paddle with a family of pigs, plus a swim with the local nurse sharks.

    - question: What makes Sandals unique in the Caribbean?
      answer: Sandals are innovators. If you enjoy food, then you are in for a treat. Sandals Resorts have up to 14 restaurants serving every cuisine you can imagine. The suites are pretty out of this world too. You won’t find anywhere else in the Caribbean with over the water suites built off a private island or infinity pools on balconies!

    - question: What’s your favourite restaurant and why?
      answer: I would have to choose one of our restaurants that has an incredible view overlooking the beach. Sushi in the Sand at Sandals South Coast in Jamaica is pretty incredible!

    - question: What does a typical day look like at a Sandals resort?
      answer: For me it involves waking up and hitting a buffet - you just can’t beat a buffet breakfast! I’ll start with salt fish and ackee with fried dumpling, followed by my body weight in pancakes. I will then roll down to the beach to catch some rays. I am a keen scuba diver so would head to a local reef or join one of the daily snorkelling trips. By then it’s time for lunch which has to be on one of our private islands looking out to sea. In the afternoon I would either have a water-skiing lesson or do a sunset yoga class and then have a massage in one of our beach gazebos. To finish the day off, I would dine under the stars listening to one of the reggae bands whilst sipping on a cocktail.

    - question: What’s the most indulgent moment you’ve had at a Sandals resort?
      answer: I was lucky enough to have a butler and after a busy day of meetings and being on my feet all day, he checked my schedule and when I got back to my suite he had run a rose-petal bubble-bath with a bottle of champagne on ice, candles flickering and chilled reggae music playing… Shame I was on my own!

    - question: What kind of person would love a Sandals resort?
      answer: I think anyone who really enjoys the freedom of choice. The choice to do as much or as little as you like. If you are a beach lover, you won’t find better than the clear turquoise waters and white glistening sand, if you like adventure whether it’s on resort with the watersports team or on an Island Routes excursions exploring the islands – you’ll never be bored. It’s also great for those that don’t like carrying a wallet! Everything is included.

    - question: What resort is on your bucket list?
      answer: Sandals Royal Barbados opening in November. All Concierge and Butler Suites, I cannot wait to swim in the rooftop pool!
